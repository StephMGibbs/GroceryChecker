# GroceryChecker
Shows who owns grocery items, from small businesses to mega corporations. Made in JavaFX.

-----
Initial Project Idea:
Create a JavaFx program that displays different items found in my local grocery store, and display whether it is:
  - Family or Founder owned
  - Private Equity owned
  - Corporate owned
  - Employee owned
  - Uknown status of ownership

Figured it is a fun way to see who owns the products I buy and research the small buisiness alternatives. Also an opportunity to practice JavaFx, and see whether I want it integrated into a webpage or as a desktop application.

-----
Initial plan:
-Create JavaFX application
-Have categories to go through (grocery items, group owned by category)
-Have search bar to lookup specific products or brands

-----
Starting point of researching who owns nationally sold products:
